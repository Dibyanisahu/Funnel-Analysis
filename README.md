# Funnel-Analysis
**Project Title**: Whitelabel Estimation Funnel Implementation

**Objective**: To implement a whitelabeled property valuation funnel on a leading real estate platform in Belgium (Platform A), optimizing user engagement and streamlining performance tracking across multiple regional brands within a unified property group.

**Project Context**: This initiative focused on building a standardized property valuation experience and launching it on Platform A. Previously, each brand—Brand X, Brand Y, and Brand Z—operated its own version of the estimation funnel, resulting in inconsistent performance and tracking. The goal was to unify and streamline the process while preserving brand-specific requirements, ensuring consistent functionality, reliable data tracking, and a seamless user experience.

The project involved close collaboration with cross-functional product and analytics teams to monitor funnel performance, set up tracking infrastructure, and improve conversion through iterative A/B testing and visual reporting.

**Data Source**: User interaction data from Google Analytics, covering the property valuation funnel steps for November 2022 across the three brands (Brand X, Brand Y, and Brand Z).

**Deliverables** : CaseStudy Report, Presentation slide, Tableau dashboard.
