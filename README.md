# Funnel-Analysis
**Project Title**: Whitelabel Estimation Funnel Implementation

**Objective**: To implement a whitelabeled property valuation funnel on Immoweb, optimizing user engagement and streamlining performance tracking across AVIV entities.

**Project Context**: This project is about creating a standardized property valuation tool and launching it on Immoweb in Belgium. Currently, each entity—Meilleurs Agents, Se Loger, and Immowelt—utilizes unique variations of the estimation funnel. The goal is to streamline these processes while maintaining entity-specific requirements, ensuring consistent functionality and enhanced user experience. The project involves collaboration with product teams to monitor performance, ensure proper data tracking, and optimize user engagement through A/B testing and dashboard development.

**Data Source**: The dataset provided for this project includes user interaction data from Google Analytics at each step of the property valuation funnel for November 2022 across three AVIV entities: Meilleurs Agents, Se Loger, and Immowelt.

** Deliverables** : CaseStudy Report, Presentation slide, Tableau dashboard.
